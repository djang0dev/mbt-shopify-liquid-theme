## Purpose
Applying the Model Based Testing on Liquid Themes with a real world example

## Steps

1. Install deps `pnpm install`
2. Set your `.env` file, see `.env.example`
3. Run `pnpm dev` to start `adastra dev`
4. Concurrently run one of the following:
    - `pnpm test:basic-homepage` to get a basic example.
    - `pnpm test:advanded-cart` to really enjoy the power of MBT, you'll need to have the seeded product `The 3P Fulfilled Snowboard` on your store, or you can just swap the `singleProductPageBaseUrl` and the `titleText` assertion with one of your product.
